Quick look at my personal projects:

Betrayal At House on the Hill: JS/HTML/CSS application that tracks player stats and other game status for a board game called Betrayal At House on the Hill

Distribution Visualiztions: Interact with various statistical distribution visualizations using Python with MatPlotLib

geopy: Python library for geotechnical engineering functions

Magic Cards: Machine learning project in Python using Magic the Gathering cards to make a design tool for custom cards. Demonstrates knowledge of various machine learning models, but overal models are not very useful because Magic cards are so complex, and design methodology varies over time.

QC Proposal builder: An example of a automated document creator I use at work. Demonstrates using docx library to create repetitive Word documents using a config file to add client and project information.
