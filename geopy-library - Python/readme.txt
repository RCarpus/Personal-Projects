Performs deep foundation design according to the NAVFAC. This tool is not to used without a complete understanding of the theory and methodology within the NAVFAC manual. It is recommended to perform traditional hand calculations along with this script to ensure the program is behaving properly and that the engineer understands what they are doing. This program makes no claims of accuracy and should not be used as a substitute for proper training and engineering knowledge. To be clear, this is a programming project to be used for academic purposes only. Do not let this program do your job for you.

This script accounts for some of the rules of thumb indicated in the design procedures. Read the comments in the code to find out what is or isn't included. Because of the nature of geotechnical engineering, these designs would make it impossible to account for all fringe cases of soil strata and/or loading conditions in the program.
