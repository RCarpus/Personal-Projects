Bituminous Paving Operations
At your request, we will review bituminous mix designs submitted by the contractor and make recommendations for approval or modification.  Plant inspections will also be provided upon request.
During paving operations, we will check surface preparation and observe bituminous mixture placement and compaction operations.  These services will include visual evaluation of the bituminous mixture delivered to the site, observing the pavement layer thickness, mix temperature, rolling procedures, and density of finished pavement.
