Foundation Construction
We will perform appropriate field tests and make observations to document building foundations have been placed on the recommended bearing soils at the design bearing elevation.  Also, the design dimensions of the foundations will be verified and the bearing surface observed to confirm the foundation excavation has been properly cleaned and prepared prior to placement of cast-in-place concrete.
