The overall budget is based on our review of the project drawings and anticipated special inspection requirements.  A detailed contractor milestone schedule was not available at the time of this proposal. Our field time is governed by the contractor and their progress.  Should the scope of our services change or construction operations require additional or less time on-site by us or our sub consultants due to delays, slow operations, or less required testing services, fees will be charged accordingly.
