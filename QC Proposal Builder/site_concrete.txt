Cast-In-Place Concrete and Site Concrete Work
Our field representative will observe concrete placement operations, perform appropriate field testing (temperature, slump, air content, unit weight, and yield), mold compression test cylinders, and observe concrete finishing and curing operations.
Laboratory testing will principally consist of testing concrete cylinders for compressive strength.
