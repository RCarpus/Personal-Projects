Earthwork Operations and Underground Utilities
Our field representative will observe subgrade preparation, including placement and compaction of engineered fill, subbase, and aggregate base materials.  We will observe proof roll operations and make recommendations for stabilizing unsuitable subgrade soils.  We will observe trench excavation operations, preparation of the trench bottom, placement of bedding layers, and placement and compaction of trench backfill, as necessary.
Our field representative will sample and evaluate fill soils and determine the moisture content and in-place dry density of engineered fill and backfill materials.  We will obtain representative samples of fill and backfill materials for laboratory testing.  Retained samples will be evaluated for grain size distribution, maximum dry density, and optimum moisture content, as necessary for use in compaction control.
In order to expedite testing operations and to minimize delays to the contractor, our field representative will use a nuclear moisture/density gauge to observe compliance of fill materials with compaction specifications.
