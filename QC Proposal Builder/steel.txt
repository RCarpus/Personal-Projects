Structural Steel and Miscellaneous Steel Construction
We are prepared to provide field quality control/quality assurance testing of all structural steel and steel decking to be placed in accordance with project specifications. Our testing services are not for fabrication, but are for verification and evaluation at the point of erection and installation.
We will provide on-site observation during steel erection operations including structural steel, steel joists, bolted connections, field welding, metal decking and metal framing.  Specifically, we will test bolt installation at mechanical connections using a torque-wrench and/or turn-of-nut method.  Our personnel will assist in obtaining and providing certified test reports from the steel supplier for shop welds.  We will also perform periodic visual inspection of light-gage metal framing to observe materials are in compliance with the applicable project specifications.
Any full penetration field welds will be evaluated by ultrasonic examination in accordance with Structural Welding Code of the American Welding Society AWS D1.1.
