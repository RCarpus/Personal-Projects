Buy a copy of this fantastic board game and play with your friends!
This project is motivated by the fact that the player cards that come with the board game are poorly designed,
and the stat sliders tend to fall off the player cards. This makes it difficult to track the stats.
This project mitigates that and makes it easier for everybody to keep track of each others' stats.

Select characters (or remove them from the game) by clicking their names on the list. Their player card will toggle on or off.
Toggling a character card does not reset the card.
Click the plus or minus button on a character's player card to modify their stats.
Click the star to the left of a player's stat slider to give them their oncer-per-game room bonus for that stat.
Click the speed roll or other stat roll button to make a stat roll for that stat. The dice appear at the top of the screen,
and the total appears to the right of the stat roll button.
Roll any specific number of dice using the roll dice buttons on the left of the screen.
Click "Make a haunt roll" to make a haunt roll. If the result is less than the total number of haunt rolls, the haunt begins,
and the "Make a haunt roll" button is turned off.
