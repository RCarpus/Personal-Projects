    "The purpose of this Python library is to enable geotechnical engineers to perform routine design calculations quickly, effortlessly, and accurately. Many of the more complicated design procedures for geotechnical engineers are already available as commercial software, but simpler procedures tend to be left to individual firms to create their own Excel templates, or to be done by hand. Excel is an adequate tool for some procedures, but other procedures are better suited for a more robust programming language due to the amount of logic and branching paths a design can take. With Geo-py, engineers can perform routine analyses and produce calculation reports effortlessly, leaving more time to focus on the big picture for a project, or simply to reduce in-house design costs. This user guide will step through the important functions available to the user to simplify their workflow."
